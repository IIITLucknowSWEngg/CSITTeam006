- *Pin and Save Content*: Users can upload and save images or videos to their accounts.
- *Board Management*: Users can create, manage, and organize boards to categorize pins.
- *Search Functionality*: Users can search for content by keywords, tags, and categories.
- *Follow Users*: Users can follow other accounts to discover new content.
- *Recommendations*: Provide personalized content based on user activity and interests.
- *Analytics (for Business Users)*: Track engagement metrics like views, repins, and comments on content.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- *Regular Users*: Individuals who use the platform to discover and save content for personal use.
- *Business Users*: Users representing brands who promote products and services.
- *Content Creators*: Users who upload original content and track its performance.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- *Client Side*: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge), mobile devices (iOS, Android)
- *Server Side*: Node.js, AWS for cloud storage, REST APIs for communication
- *Database*: MongoDB for storing user data, pins, and boards

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- The application must be responsive and work on different screen sizes.
- High-quality images and videos must be optimized for fast load times.
- Secure image and video uploads with content moderation mechanisms.
