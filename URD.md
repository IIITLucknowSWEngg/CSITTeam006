Admins will have the ability to manage content and users. The platform will support social sharing and provide notifications for registered users.

### 1.3 Definitions
- **User**: A person who accesses the platform to browse and search for pins.
- **Registered User**: A user who has created an account and can save, pin, and organize content.
